/**
 * What a card says about a person, block by block and line by line, and who may
 * read or change which.
 *
 * A position is given the lines it needs rather than "personal data" as a lump:
 * the head of a department has business knowing a telephone number and none at
 * all knowing a passport. Reading and changing are asked separately — plenty of
 * people should see a passport and nobody but HR should retype one.
 *
 * Each line is two rights, so the whole machinery around rights applies to them
 * unchanged: a position carries them, a personal exception overrules them, and
 * an administrator passes every check.
 *
 * The same lines are asked about twice over, because the two questions are not
 * the same one: what a position may read on a colleague's card, and what it may
 * read on its own. Somebody who has no business in anybody else's passport still
 * has a passport of their own, and a company may well let nobody correct their
 * own hire date. So each line is four rights — read and change, somebody else's
 * card and one's own — and the scope says which pair is meant.
 *
 * The surname and the name are not on the list. A list of colleagues whose names
 * are hidden is a list of blank rows, and a card with no name on it answers
 * nothing; so those two are always readable and the rest is decided.
