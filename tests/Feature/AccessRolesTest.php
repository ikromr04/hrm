 * exception: the system administrator passes every check while holding no rights
 * at all, because somebody has to be able to reach the page where rights are
 * handed out. There is exactly one of them — the position is offered nowhere,
 * cannot be given to anybody and cannot be given up.
 *
 * Every other position is ordinary, «Администратор» included. The only rule about
 * positions besides that one protects whoever hands rights out: the positions of
 * somebody who may change the access table are theirs alone and the system
 * administrator's, because taking their positions away takes away what they may do.
